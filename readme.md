Project-Blog w/ Rails
- My first rails deployed application
- Originally developed in Sinatra

Everyone @ [Omaha Code School](http://omahacodeschool.com) made a blog. We each tried to put somewhat of a spin on it to make it at least somewhat interesting. I decided to make a blog that would read posts, assign a numerical value to key words based upon their individual connotation. The Moody Bloogs was born. The entry would have a total that was applied to a geographic region based upon where the user said they were when they signed up. Everything is stored in plain text, it is extremely rough, but mostly functional. I had some trouble with the heatmap resizing to the map I overlay it on.
